App Plan

- This App uses a React/Redux front end and Rails backend.
- It connects to GoogleBooks API to search for books and allows the user to save the book to their WatchList/BookList.

- Project Requirements:
  X The code should be written in ES6 as much as possible
  X It uses Create-React-App
  X Your app should have one HTML page to render your react-redux application
  X There should be 2 container (manage State) components
  X There should be 5 stateless (Presentational) components
  X There should be 3 routes
  X The Application must make use of react-router and proper RESTful routing (should you choose to use react-router v3 please refer to the appropriate docs; docs for v4 can be found here)
  X Use Redux middleware to respond to and modify state change
  X Make use of async actions to send data to and receive data from a server
  X Your Rails API should handle the data persistence. You should be using fetch() within your actions to GET and POST data from your API - do not use jQuery methods.
  X Your client-side application should handle the display of data with minimal data manipulation
  X Your application should have some minimal styling: feel free to stick to a framework (like react-bootstrap), but if you want to write (additional) CSS yourself, go for it!
